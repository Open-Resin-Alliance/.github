## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
We're a group of people from around the globe, based in Germany.
<br><br>
Our projects, primarily software for open-source resin 3d printing, as well as reference designs, are located here.
> :information_source: Some projects have grown and moved from TheContrappostoShop to the ORA to better serve the whole community.

- The [Odyssey Backend](https://github.com/Open-Resin-Alliance/Odyssey)
- The [Orion Frontend](https://github.com/Open-Resin-Alliance/Orion)

Join us in our mission to support and enhance open-source resin printing projects!
